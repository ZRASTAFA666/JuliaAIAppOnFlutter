# Integration with Julia

The AI engine is built using Julia for high-performance natural language processing.

## Communication

- Flutter uses platform channels to send text prompts to Julia.
- Julia processes the request and returns generated content via native channels.

## Julia Setup (coming soon)

You will need to install required Julia packages and set up a communication bridge. This process will be documented in detail in future updates.
